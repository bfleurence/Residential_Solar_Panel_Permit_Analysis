# Solar Panel Permit Data Analysis

## Overview

This paper analyzes the publicly available data set Building Permits-Solar Hot Water Heaters. It gives insight into the Toronto residential solar panel industry from 2008-2024. A drastic decrease in demand following 2012 tariffâ€™s on Chinese manufactured Solar Panels amdist the U.S and China economic trade war, shows the negative affects geo-political decisions can have on a seemingly un-related in- dustry.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

This project benefitted from the use of a language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to assist in generating code, simulating data, and troubleshooting issues. The LLM provided support for:

Drafting code for data simulation and analysis
Providing guidance on R syntax and library usage
Offering suggestions for data visualization and organization
